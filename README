Build Instructions:

To compile blobs, run
	make
in your terminal. If you, for some strange reason, want the tool to fork into the background and kill itself (leaving an orphan process to do the dancing), type
	make fork

Installation:

You can simply copy the blobs file anywhere you want. If you'd like it to go to the default /usr/local/bin location, type
	make install
